- 👋 Hi, My Name is @PoseidonBroZeus, I am a novic code developer and hope to learn a lot here.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Programming (shocker) and in the future aim for more experience in Cinematography and Game Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, Java, Python, and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web design or Game design, I'd probably be working at a pretty low level, but it's experience that I need.
- 📫 How to reach me; I have my dead (i killed it) twitter main account @PoseidonBroZeu1, and my less dead @BlackblightG second account, you can also reach me at:
- Reddit- u/PoseidonBroZeus, Artstation- PoseidonBroZeus, Discord- PoseidonBroZeus#2736
